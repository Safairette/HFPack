## HF Weapon Pack

A small weapon pack adding 2 experimental high-capacity weapons and their charge counterparts:

- HFP-7 - a somewhat bulky machine pistol with extremely high magazine capacity, but an underpowered cartridge
- HFP-C - a charge upgrade moving it to a much more powerful 6x18mm cartridge

- HF-2 - a twin-barreled PDW with a higher maganize capacity and a slighly extended range
- HFC-2 - a charge upgrade also chambered in 6x18mm, increasing the versatility of the platform
